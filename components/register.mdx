In 2019 we introduced exciting new kit with an Indigenous design by an Aboriginal artist, [Amunda Gorey](https://www.facebook.com/amundagoreyart/). Amunda kindly provided the Sharks with the design and allowed us to incorporate the Sharks colours (greens) and the traditional colours of the Aboriginal people (red, black and yellow)!

The Indigenous design is a perfect fit for our Club as it represents

Registration for new players includes a Sharks guernsey, shorts, socks, mouth guard, cap and footy. Boys & Girls aged 7 – 14 (as of 1st Jan 2022) will also play Lightning Rounds and will collect a special Lightning Rounds guernsey later in the season.

Kit will be available for collection at Shark Park at the Australian International School the next session after you sign up. Refer to the Schedule & Programs page for timings and location details.

You can indicate whether you wish to volunteer for an assistant coaching role or check-in volunteer on the registration form.
